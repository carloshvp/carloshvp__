### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on bringing together IoT and Machine Learning at scale. From the ultra-low-power edge ([TinyML](https://www.meetup.com/tinyML-Enabling-low-Power-ML-at-the-edge-Stuttgart-Germany/)) to the clouds (AWS and Azure so far)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning a bunch of things, because the topic above is very wide! All what I learn, I try to bring back to the community. Therefore I am so happy that I was recognized as [AWS Community Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/community-builders-directory/?cb-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.cbName&cb-cards.sort-order=asc&awsf.builder-category=*all&awsf.location=*all&awsf.year=*all&cb-cards.q=carlos%2Bhernandez-vaquero&cb-cards.q_operator=AND) and offered to become a Mentor in the epic [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) in Coursera from Prof. Andre Ng. I also volunteer in several other communities providing advice and counseling as [Certified Mentor](https://www.mentoring-club.com/the-mentors/carlos-hernandez-vaquero) at The Mentoring Club, Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador and Github Campus Expert.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything related to IoT devices doing inferencing with optimized deep learning models and delivering reliable cloud services at scale (e.g. AWS SageMaker Neo, Apache TVM, TensorFlow Lite Micro...).
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for experts in the domain who are interested in public speaking (e.g. [TinyML](https://www.meetup.com/tinyML-Enabling-low-Power-ML-at-the-edge-Stuttgart-Germany/) talks, where I am one of the organizers) or simply exchanging experiences and networking.
- âš¡ If you didn't hear about TinyML before and I have raised your interest, you can do the [Hands-on TinyML](https://codered.eccouncil.org/course/hands-on-tinyml) course at the EC-Council, which I authored or watch for free one of our latest TinyML talks to see if this is something interesting for you:
