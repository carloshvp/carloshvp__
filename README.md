### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on bringing together IoT and Machine Learning. From the ultra-low-power edge ([TinyML](https://www.meetup.com/tinyML-Enabling-low-Power-ML-at-the-edge-Stuttgart-Germany/)) to the clouds (AWS and Azure so far)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a bunch of things, because the topic above is sooo wide! All what I learn, I try to bring back to the community. Therefore I am so happy that I was offered to become a Mentor in the epic [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) in Coursera from Prof. Andre Ng. This was probably one of the reasons for which I was nominated to become AWS Community Builder in the Machine Learning category. I also volunteer in several other communities providing advice and counseling as Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador and Github Campus Expert.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything related to IoT devices doing inferencing with optimized deep learning models (e.g. TVM, TensorFlow Lite Micro, AWS SageMaker Neo...)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for experts in the domain who are interested in public speaking (e.g. [TinyML](https://www.meetup.com/tinyML-Enabling-low-Power-ML-at-the-edge-Stuttgart-Germany/) talks, where I am one of the organizers) or simply exchanging experiences and networking. Feel free watch one of our latest TinyML talks to see if this is something interesting for you:
